There was evidence of perforated ulcer on both \\nCT abdomen and upper GI series (posterior antral leak to lesser \\nsac). Initially he was kept NPO with IV hydration and placed on \\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics with pip-tazo and fluconazole from \\n___. \\nHe underwent EGD on ___ with the following finding: large \\nulcer measuring approximately 5-6cm was seen in the first part \\nof the duodenum.  There was likely perforation around the edge \\nof the ulcer measuring 2-3cm -This appeared contained. The \\nperforation was too large for endoscopic intervention. There was \\nalso moderate to severe esophagitis in the distal esophagus with \\nportal hypertensive gastropathy seen. H. pylori was negative. He \\nwas put on the maximum dose of PPI.  A NG was in place. \\nHe underwent exploratory laparotomy by Dr. ___, but \\nwas found to have a frozen abdomen thus unable to see perforated \\nstomach. Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management \\nas he was hypotensive and hematocrit had decreased. He was given \\nalbumin and 4 units of PRBC. Hct stabilized, but on ___, he \\nhad brief episode of SVT with rate of 160 without blood pressure \\ndrop; afib with intermittent RVR that was treated with \\nmetoprolol IV x 2 with decrease in BP. The patient required \\npressors and amiodarone was started (please see #Afib below). \\n\\nHe transferred out of the SICU and was started on TPN. Afib was \\nmanaged with metoprolol. Metoprolol dose was increased and he \\nwas given intermittent doses of Lasix for volume control and \\npulmonary edema seen on CXR. \\n\\nHis diet was initially advanced to clears then full liquids. \\nHowever, he did not tolerate advancement to a regular diet. He \\nexperienced a lot of abdominal pain. Diet was changed to just \\nsips of clears and pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA.  His \\ndiet was eventually changed to tube feeds and then regular diet \\nas per an initial goals of care discussion. An abdominal CT \\n___ an 8cm loculated fluid collection in lesser \\nsac. He then underwent ___ placement of a drain in the \\nfluid collection. Microbiology evaluation of the fluid \\ncollection did not grow any organisms, so antibiotics were \\ndiscontinued on ___.  ___ continued to follow the drain until \\noutput was < 5cc for 2 consecutive days, at which point the \\ndrain was pulled.  Diet was advanced slowly for comfort, with \\nsupplemental nutrition from nasogastric tube feeds.  After a \\ngoals of care meeting on ___, Pt endorsed a desire to \\ntransition towards measures that would improve his comfort.  In \\nlight of this, his NGT was pulled ___ and he was permitted a \\nregular PO diet, which he tolerated well. Patient was continued \\non sucralfate for continued gastric coating and comfort.  PPI \\nand other unnecessary medicines were held.\\n\\n# GOALS OF CARE DISCUSSION:\\nPt with poor prognosis due to his perforated viscus, surgically \\nfrozen abdomen, and non-transplant candidacy.  A goals of care \\nmeeting was held on ___ with the patient and his friend, as \\nwell as newly-chosen HCP, ___.  At this meeting, Pt \\nacknowledged the severity of his illness and endorsed a \\nwillingness to transition his course more towards \\ncomfort-focused care.  Medicines that would not contribute to \\nhis comfort were discontinued.  Unnecessary tubes and lines, \\nincluding his NGT and PICC line, were removed prior to \\ndischarge.  Patient was discharged to a ___ facility for \\nhousing and further titration of his care.\\n\\n# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS with\\n# ASCITES and\\n# NEED FOR SBP PPX:\\nPreviously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, grade \\nI esophageal varices.  Pt without significant hepatic \\nencephalopathy or large ascites during his hospital stay; he was \\ninitially put on oral diuretics to minimize the ascites and risk \\nof wound dehiscence, but these were held in the setting of \\nsignificant weight loss while on tube feeds and overall hypo- to \\neuvolemic appearance on exam.  Patient was continued on Bactrim \\nfor SBP prophylaxis.  He was continued on lactulose to keep his \\nmental status clear.  Given goals of care discussion as above, \\nvitamins such as thiamine and multivitamin were discontinued.\\n\\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:\\nHad one episode of Afib on ___, for which he was amiodarone \\nloaded and started on amio gtt.  He was stable on PO metoprolol \\nin-house, though sometimes limited due to soft blood pressures.  \\nHe had a CHADS-VASC of 0.  Given his goals of care discussion at \\ndischarge, PO metoprolol was discontinued.  Anticoagulation was \\ndeferred given recent surgery as well as goals of care \\ndiscussion as above.\\n\\n# NUTRITION:\\nInitially requiring TPN, then tube feeds by ___.  He \\ncontinued to lose muscle mass despite optimal nutrition on TF's. \\n After goals of care discussion ___, patient was provided with \\na regular diet - which he tolerated well.  \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\n--------------------\\n# CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI, CMO, Do not Hospitalize\\n# CONTACT:  Friend/HCP, ___ (___)\\n\\n[ ] GOALS OF CARE:\\n- Pt transitioned to DNR/DNI and comfort measures only, given \\nhis poor prognosis and lack of surgical alternatives for his \\nmedical conditions.\\n\\n[ ] PAIN MANAGEMENT:\\n- If patient is requiring more than 3 daily doses of oxycodone \\nfor breakthrough pain, consider uptitrating his TID oxyconTIN \\nfor further long-lasting pain relief.\\n\\n[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES:\\n- Added:  Oxycodone 10mg PO q2h:PRN breakthrough pain, \\nacetaminophen 500mg Q6H, Bactrim DS 1 tab daily, lidocaine \\npatch, oxyconTIN 20mg PO TID, sucralfate 1gm PO QID, \\npolyethylene glycol 17g daily\\n- Changed:  Lactulose (QID -> TID), Bactrim (1 SS tab -> 1 DS \\ntab for SBP Ppx)\\n- Stopped: Metoprolol, Vitamins, furosemide, lansoprazole\\n\\n=== DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS ===\\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\\nGastric perforation, frozen abdomen.\\nDuodenal ulcer\\nEsophagitis\\n\\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSES:\\nportal hypertensive gastropathy\\nanemia\\nmalnutrition\\nCirrhosis\n",
